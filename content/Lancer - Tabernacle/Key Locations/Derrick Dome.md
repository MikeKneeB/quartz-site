Largest habitat dome on [[Tabernacle III - Cruet|Cruet]]. Largely owned by [[Octopotenta BioTech]], but day-to-day operation is done by the limited corporation Derrick Dome Administration (DDA).

There is also a space elevator at Derrick, which leads up to the Derrick space port.

## Purpose

- Main planetary hub
- Military post

## Curiosities

- [[HORUS XO_howl_OX|HORUS technocult]] operation in dome maintenance areas. Derrick administration denies their existence.
- Weapons dealer does business out of an old apartment stack. Friendly, but all-business.

## Problems

- Growing civil unrest, ongoing gate crisis is affecting ordinary people, and Derrick administration isn’t responding very well.
- Gravity stabilisers are broken, vastly increasing the effective gravity for citizen’s daily lives.
