An [[Alzabo Extraction|Alzabo]] managed militarised mining outpost in [[the Gilt Chain]] over a quarter turn clockwise around the belt from [[Coma Station]]. Formerly a mining facility for rare earth metals on an enormous planetoid designated GC-278, once the seam was exhausted Indigo became a useful stop-off point logistically as it was roughly two radians from Alzabo's central operations, making it a good fuel and supplies depot.

The area is on an elevated region of the planetoid; open quarrying was carried out around the area nearby, and while the quarry does not lead directly up to the walls, it gives the outpost a bit of a towering fortress aesthetic by accident.

There are two perimeters - an outer wall and an inner fort. The courtyard has a number of supply buildings and there are several areas that could be scoured for equipment; indeed, it appears that's what the intransigents are doing.
