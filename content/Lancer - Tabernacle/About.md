This is setting notes and session reports for a game of [Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer) I'm running set in the Tabernacle system. I used the expansion [The Long Rim](https://massif-press.itch.io/the-long-rim) extensively to generate up the system, although this is not actually in the Long Rim itself.

The setting is heavily inspired by *The Algebraist* by Iain M. Banks, a system cut-off from external assistance and under threat from an expansionist empire is the framing that book uses as well (but that's effectively where the similarities end).

We're starting off at LL2 rather than 0 - all the players are TTRPG veterans so as a group we decided that would be more fun. It gives everyone a unique frame at the beginning, which is one of the things I think the core book misses the mark on. The Everest is a great frame, but it is a little boring for everyone to have the same thing at LL0.

See [[Gate Crisis]] for the opening text-crawl.
