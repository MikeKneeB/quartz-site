This is setting notes and session reports for a game of [Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer) we're playing set in the Tabernacle system. I used the expansion [The Long Rim](https://massif-press.itch.io/the-long-rim) extensively to generate up the system, although this is not actually in the Long Rim itself.

The setting is heavily inspired by *The Algebraist* by Iain M. Banks, a system cut-off from external assistance and under threat from an expansionist empire is the framing that book uses as well (but that's effectively where the similarities end).

We're starting off at LL2 rather than 0 - all the players are TTRPG veterans so as a group we decided that would be more fun. It gives everyone a unique frame at the beginning, which is one of the things I think the core book misses the mark on. The Everest is a great frame, but it is a little boring for everyone to have the same thing at LL0.

The game is being GM'd by two people, myself (Mike Knee) and my good friend and fellow "Normal Thoughts About Lancer" haver Nafees Mujtaba. We're alternating missions, with two intertwined parts of the story being picked up in each half (or at least, that's the rough plan, but neither of us have prepped a plot so anything could happen).

See [[Gate Crisis]] for the opening text-crawl.
