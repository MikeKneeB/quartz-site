The **In Defence of My Name** is a large broad-shouldered humanoid mech, which has no discernible head. On the back are a set of four long curving spines that sweep backwards from the body. The body itself is made up of a series of plates, which are held together by an internal swarm of moths, visible between the plates. The neck area is an open indentation, moths flutter up and back in in weird murmuration patterns. Autumn is just in the middle of this, I guess. The moths appear to be marbled emperor moths.
