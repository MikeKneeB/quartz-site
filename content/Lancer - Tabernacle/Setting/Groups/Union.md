The Union presence in the system is cut off from the wider galaxy, but still present and attempting to continue its aims of uplift and protection.

## Biography

Ben Kilmer (he/him) is a Union investigator, a detective. Union's "policing" is fairly avant-garde compared to most modern real-world organisations, but they still have use of detectives to investigate crimes. As part of the Union Department of Justice and Human Rights (DoJ/HR), his reach is long and his remit broad. The New Division knew of the [[DerBoa Empire]] long before recent events, but it's only now that this has become exceedingly important.

Starting as part of the Universe-Building Mission for the sector, Kilmer's assignment over the last six months has been linked to the [[Gate Crisis]] - as the only official investigator in the system, he was the finest and nearest Union detective available. Most other Union DoJ staff were either outside the system at the time or at the Gate when the Crisis occurred.

Ben is a figure whose emphasis on results leads to behaviour on the borders of acceptability within Union regulations. While the DoJ/HR is normally treated with distaste by corporations, on the galactic fringes, it's downright hostile. With corporations, it is only the threat of economic sanctions that causes them not to do harm to DoJ representatives. With everyone else, it ranges from fear to lead and lasers. As such, Ben's often had to cut deals he'd rather avoid and make bargains he can't always immediately afford. All in the name of progress, of course - the glowing beacon of Union is sometimes dimmer when you're this far out and away.

Up until recently, Kilmer has functionally been working alone, with a powerful mech of his own named the Rector v8.03 (supported by his silent comp/con unit named Vance). Unfortunately, Ben's mech systems and repair facilities were recently hacked by an unknown person or persons, and the Rector's been out of action since. While he has a retinue of reliable staff, they're not mercenaries. As such, he has had to call upon the [[ENLIL Adherents]] in order to advance his inquiries as they have now come to a head. 

It's been rumoured that the Gate Crisis was something actioned by the DerBoa Empire for weeks - the coincidences of scouting forces being sighted a month or so ago and engagements with DerBoa outrunners reported in the local net were too suspicious not to be directly linked.

Ben seems confident there is a link, but seems to fall short of confirming this - because he needs to close his cases before he can make broad statements confirming any allegations.

## Tactical Operations Expertise

Kilmer, as a Union investigator, is extremely skilled in many different areas, from self defence to mechanical engineering, but his most powerful asset is his connection to Union. As such, Ben is normally afforded respect if not authority, even if his presence as essentially police is treated with suspicion. Nevertheless, Union is an aspiration for most systems, so Kilmer's affiliation still means something. Attacking an administrator of Union's business is a sure way to draw punitive attention. 

For his work, Ben has access to one of the most valuable resources in the galaxy - Union intelligence. Where these sources come from is not always known - CentComm does not consider the DoJ/HR privy to the sources of some of this information, let alone rank-and-file UBM personnel, but the information has rarely ever been incorrect in the history of the DoJ; the usefulness of this information is varied - but it isn't wrong. Ben assumes it's from a network of spies or hacking NHPs, but this feels unlikely given the accuracy of the information.

Ben's skill comes from the translation of raw data and information into useable tactical operations data. He's a strategy analyst with countless critical assistance missions and liberator teams overseen and coordinated for Union. As such, he is able to provide operational intelligence in advance of missions whenever he or a CAM/L-Team is about to deploy.
