# Enlil

The storm god, the initially recovered entity found in [[Tabernacle V - The Gilt Chain|The Gilt Chain]] by [[ENLIL Adherents#Gorn Tyburn|Gorn]] and [[ENLIL Adherents#William Gamej|Bill]].

Enlil is a capricious god, fickle and mercurial, and occasionally harshly decisive.

The entity manifests as a 12 metre long black obelisk, still partially embedded in a portion of asteroid rock it was initially discovered in. It is obsidian black, and carved with grooves in geometric patterns. There are small floating sections of the black rock suspended around the entity, these are totally immobile and unmovable.
