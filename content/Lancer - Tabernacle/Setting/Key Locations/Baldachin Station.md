Collection of abandoned freighters and shipping vessels, all lashed and welded together some 200 years ago. Since been continually added to, and eventually incorporated into its own conglomerate. This was then bought by [[Morel Central Bank]], and is now operated exclusively by MCB. Residents maintain a free-booter spirit from its founding days, despite now being effectively run by a bank.

## Purpose

- Hydroponic/terrestrial analogous farming.  
- Entertainment.  

## Curiosities

- An old schedule 2 printer - in terrible shape.
- Opulent SSC pleasure barge (Peacelily in Morning Light) stranded at the station since the beginning of the Gate Crisis. They were throwing parties, but now the owner is presumably somewhat existentially hungover at this point.

## Problems

- Supplies are critically short and hoarding is commonplace.
- The station's life support systems are in desperate need of repair.
