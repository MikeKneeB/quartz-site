### Tabernacle 2.5
Tabernacle II has a large moon almost comparable in size of the planet. This is known as Tabernacle 2.5 colloquially.

The moon, due to a strange quirk of its thin atmosphere, is extremely hot while under direct sunlight, but cools relatively quickly once it is eclipsed by the planet itself.
