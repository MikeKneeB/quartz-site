The fast cruiser **An Unlikely Angel** is down on the surface of the planet Cruet. Not even a minor newsline on the net, as the Tabernacle system continues to degrade from simple resource scarcity and rising hostility from the DerBoa forces.

However, [[Octopotenta BioTech]] would very much like to retrieve some of their cargo, which was apparently on board. This raises the importance of this event from same-old to high priority as the Adherents are contacted to retrieve their cargo. Your contact on the OBT side is a woman named Revel Hour.

The crash site is under jurisdiction of the [[Morel Central Bank]], who have moved in and already formally denied [[Octopotenta BioTech]]'s request to send in their own team. Nothing has yet been moved from **An Unlikely Angel**, as far as current intel suggests there is an advance mercenary planet-side force guarding the wreck. The main decomm and reclamation team is mobilising now from [[Baldachin Station]], but a well-placed bureaucrat has been given a rather generous anonymous gift, and they are held up.

Get in past the [[Morel Central Bank]] mercenary forces, with Revel in tow, let her handle the cargo, and then get out. What could go wrong?

# Mission Report

## In and Out in Twenty Minutes

The adherents plan to move in over the frozen lake to the north of the Tor Elise Dome. They will attack the dam facility marked at A on the [[#Tor Elise Area]] map. A quick surgical strike on any resistance, and then they hope to hack into the dam system and send out a fake warning alarm to clear the rest of the **DLS** mercenaries from the area. Then they can move in and recover the **Octopotenta** asset without issue.

What could go wrong?

First on the agenda, as the team moves up towards the dam facilities, they spy a relatively small group of **DLS** mercenaries. Perfect for a quick ambush.

Moving up, they lock eyes on

- Will the Lancers secure the package?
- What actually is the package?

## Maps

### Tor Elise Area

### Tor Elise Dome

![[tor_elise_int.png]]


## Tor Elise
Is an abandoned habitat dome deep in the mountains. It sits in a wide valley, just underneath a large hyrdo-power dam. The dam is owned and operated by [[Morel Central Bank]], and thus Tor Elise was as well.

Parts running short and maintenance proving close to impossible, the dam has suffered some "minor" loss of structural integrity, and there are no supplies to repair it. The habitat dome at its base is now abandoned, along with the titanium mining operation ([from ilmenite deposits](https://kyocera-sgstool.co.uk/titanium-resources/titanium-information-everything-you-need-to-know/titanium-ores/)) in the surrounding mountains that was powered by it.

**An Unlikely Angel** has crashed almost directly into the habitat dome.

## The Glimmer Peaks
Is a mountainous region of [[Tabernacle III - Cruet|Cruet]], near the equator. Regions of the mountain range have been found to be rich in titanium deposits, and are one of the major industries on the planet.

The mercenary team **DLS** is in the area, contracted by [[Morel Central Bank]] to stand guard until they can send in their own team. **DLS** doesn't stand for anything.

## An Unlikely Angel
Is a fast courier ship operated by [[Minor Concerns#Apollo's Promise|Apollo's Promise]]. Charter is not necessarily easy to uncover. But - sent out from a station on [[Tabernacle I]] which falls under [[Octopotenta BioTech]] although is actually a cover for an SSC exotic materials laboratory. The cover story is bio-photonics research, the truth is the development of the *Corona Mantle*.
