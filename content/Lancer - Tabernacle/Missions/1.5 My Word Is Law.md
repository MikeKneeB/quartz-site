We're now definitively decided on the name **Bellerophon** for the ship found and now crewed by the Enlil Adherents.

Flying back to the **Bellerophon**, with the sarcophagus containing the Corona Mantle (and the woman it's embedded in), the crew has a moment of rest and respite.

# Pinnacle

[[ENLIL Adherents#William Gamej|Bill]] is simmering with fury, and wants answers from his erstwhile demi-god. He places a hand on the obelisk and is brought beyond himself to the wind-wracked peak of Enlil.

As the wind whips, up on the crags, a monstrous suggestion of feathers and a yellow spherical eye gazes down at him. He wants to know why Revel had to die, what was so important to Enlil that the first words she spoke to him were "Kill Them".

And, as the great bird shifts down towards him, taking on a humanoid form blurring and shifting into the suggestion of great flapping wings, she speaks back like a chime in his head. The Corona Mantle connects to [[The Anunnaki]], acting as a conduit for their voice to be heard in the physical world. The Mantle's proximity allowed Enlil to speak at all, and now allows it to take on form.

The Mantle, and its bearer, can become the voice of Enlil.

_We used the brand new and excitingly untested [[#Commune Downtime Action]]_

# Who the Hell is She Anyway?

[[ENLIL Adherents#Lonnie Abel|Lonnie]] would like to know exactly who the hell this woman is anyway? Who is this lady frozen in our cargo hold. He heads back to the warren of [[Baldachin Station]] to surf the NET and find out. Radical.

Hacking in on public computers, he discovers this woman is an ex-merc named Catherine Hallow. She was picked up by [[Octopotenta Biotech]] for what appeared to be a series of fairly routine jobs over the last few years, and subsequently went missing on one of those; the internal action report was thin on details and high on allusion.

Unfortunately, Lonnie is going to have to implicate someone innocent as part of his hacking, so casually decides to implicate whoever this bozo is sitting next to him at the NET cafe.

# Commune Downtime Action

The first time you take this action with a specific higher power or entity gain 2 faith with that entity and make a note of this. Your faith cannot go above 6 or below 0.

When you attempt to commune with a power beyond mortal minds roll:

**On a 9 or Less:**

You receive fractured, mind twisting visions, lose 1 faith to ask for clarity on one topic the entity could understand.

**On 10-19:**

You commune with the power and sift through the visions it gives you. Choose 2:

- Gain 1 faith if you recently demonstrated devotion to the power.
- Ask for clarity on one topic the entity could understand.
- Spend 1 faith to gain additional clarity on the same topic, or a different topic, the entity could understand.
- Gain foreknowledge of the future, and note it in your reserves for the next mission.

**On a 20+**

Gain 1 faith, then choose 2 options as above.

## Foreknowledge

Foreknowledge can be spent after any roll takes place to change the result (after adding bonuses and any accuracy/difficulty) to a 19.
