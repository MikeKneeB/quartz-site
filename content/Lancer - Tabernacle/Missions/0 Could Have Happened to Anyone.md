The entity known as ENLIL has charted a course to a largely uninhabited region of the moon [[Tabernacle III - Cruet|Pyx]]. He promises safety, a place out of the way and safe from the foes of the divine manifest.

Aboard the stolen mining survey vessel **Enemy of Perfection**, piloted by *Olia Moure*, the crew are on there way over there.

Currently manoeuvring in Cruet's gravity well, the [[DerBoa Empire|DerBoa]] jugular-class fast attack ship **Bloodlapper** is locked on, and ready to begin boarding actions.

# Mission Report

## Metal On Metal

[[ENLIL Adherents#Yumei|Yumei]] on the bridge, staring out at the stars, catches *Olia* tense up. Something's coming in fast on radar, and the **Enemy of Perfection** lurches like it's been physically grabbed. Ship alarms sound, and the whole interior is washed crimson in emergency lights. Suit up Lancers, we're under attack.

In the hangar bay the crew scrambles into their mechs just as an appalling howl of grinding metal on metal reverbates through the hull. Two gigantic breach drills rip through the hull, white hot and dripping slag.

The boarding crew of the **Bloodlapper** pour out, led by *Uthgerd Iro* in the **Crown of Thorns**[^4]. The crew stand their ground, engaging in a quick & bloody combat:
- The Breacher **Pleased to Meetcha** bursts physically through the boarding drill with a ram, and tries to shotgun **Feline Pain** (*Mi-Tenz*) & **Cruel World** (*Gorn*). *Gorn* proceeds to grapple, and then smack the crap out of them.
- *Lonnie* dashes forward, leaving mirage trails and a mine, which the **Crown of Thorns** dutifully steps on - dealing pretty cataclysmic damage[^5].
- The **Edge of Reason** locks onto the **Euphrates** (*William*) with a Sniper's Mark. *William* plays an uno-reverse - activating Hunter Lock and demolishing them basically instantly.
- **Optional Philosophy** charges forward, chain axe whirring. Unfortunately the **Feline Pain** isn't so easy to pin down.
- **Liar's Dice** activates their cloaking field, rendering them and their allies invisible. *Lonnie* can't get a bead on any of them with their veil rifle or tech attacks.

But, through the chaos and carnage, the crew emerge victorious.[^6]


# Mission Setup

## Plot Beats/Questions/Goals
- Opens with boarding action from the **Bloodlapper** boarding crew.
- Escape from the **Bloodlapper**
- Rendevous or not with the **Warmest Regards**
- Defeat or escape from **Octavio**
- Find a way to [[Tabernacle III - Cruet#Pyx|Pyx]]

## Enemy of Perfection

Medium/small survey vessel. Not really outfitted for combat in any meaningful way (anti-asteroid PDCs). [[Alzabo Extraction|Alzabo]] would probably like this back - but at this point it seems somewhat unlikely. Loss of company property will be noted.

### Who's Here?
- ENLIL
- The Lancers
- Olia Moure - Pilot (she/her)
- Marie Hon - Mechanic (she/her)
- Autumn Fall - Drone Operator (she/her)

### Key Locations
- Hangar bay, currently housing ENLIL, the Lancers' mechs, and a small transport shuttle (not rated for use in atmosphere), and various survey drones (operable by Autumn).
- Bridge, Olia and Autumn are here.
- Engine room, Marie is here.
- Other normal ship locations.

## Bloodlapper

Jugular-class corvette, outfitted for skirmish, armed with various minor guns, a STOP drive, and a comms shroud. Has sustained some not-insignificant battle damage, and is down on crew capacity significantly.

They have captured the **Warmest Regards**, a small outrigger for [[The Big Dogs]], which is currently sitting in their main hangar. They'd like to get it open, but they don't really have the cutting tools on hand to open up the hardened vessel, and preferably they'd keep the crew alive. With the **Warmest Regards** effectively under STOP interdiction, and guns disabled, both sides are sitting tight.

### Who's Here?
- The crew of the **Bloodlapper**, led by Octavio Mon (she/her). Severely depleted after fighting with the **Warmest Regards** crew.
- The crew of the **Warmest Regards**, a pirate vessel flying [[The Big Dogs]] colours. The ship is in the **Bloodlapper** hangar, currently sealed off. It is led by Horace Hoenheim (he/they). They're basically out of options, apart from sealing the doors.
  - Did have complement of mechs, all destroyed in fighting with **Bloodlapper** crew.
  - Few small weapons and similar.

### Key Locations
- Main hangar, with the **Warmest Regards** and crew inside.
- Bridge, probably with Octavio on deck.
- STOP drive
- Engine bay

[^4]: The **Bloodlapper** boarding crew consists of:
    - *Uthgerd Iro*, pilotting the **Crown of Thorns** (Veteran Bastion pattern)
    - *Keep Lawrence*, in the **Liar's Dice** (Scout pattern)
    - *Mourn Sunset*, in the **Optional Philosophy** (Berserker pattern)
    - *Qor Bex*, in the **Pleased to Meetcha** (Breacher pattern)
    - *Kour Bao*, in the **Edge of Reason** (Sniper pattern)

[^5]: I personally, as the GM, should have played this smarter - but it was the first combat so I just let the **Crown of Thorns** take the hit. In future, I'll be playing around mines more carefully.

[^6]: Pretty good first combat, not a real threat, but introduced a lot of concepts. We're in it! Folks made use of their tools, to good effect, we eventually ironed out how firing weapons works. The aux/main and flex mounts aren't easy to get on first pass.
