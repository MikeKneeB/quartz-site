## Detail

The Morel Central Bank operates throughout the local cluster. They are the de-facto standard currency (m-cred) for numerous systems, and oversee/operate a reasonable sized portion of stations in the local cluster. Within the tabernacle system, the ongoing gate crisis means that the strength of the Morel Bank in-system is somewhat diminished without access to the rest of the organisation. They still operate some key stations and m-cred is used almost exclusively for day-to-day transactions in Tabernacle.
