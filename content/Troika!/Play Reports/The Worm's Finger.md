This was a drop-in session of Troika! running an adventure I wrote called [The Worm's Finger](https://gentlyrotting.itch.io/the-worms-finger), which is a wet and sad dungeon that I'm pretty proud of.

The players are told where they're going and what might lurk there, namely an abandoned facility on the shoreline, in which is likely a great deal of treasure and ancient secrets all guarded by the **Vermiform Hag**.

# Sodden Trudge

As the wind and driving rain lash the shore the camera pans down to reveal our five hearty adventurers. Leading the way is **Brian** the Argent Giant of Corda, a 3 metre tall man with a long coat. Behind him, sheltering from the rain in his leeward side, is **Nickel** the Claviger. Behind them are a pair of Sorcerors, though of different schools: **Abraca David** of the College of Friends and **Arcanon** of the Academy of Doors. Bringing up the rear, adorned with very small hat and very small spear (in comparison to his large size) is **Bash** the Rhino Man.

Soon, the black slick rock of the sea stack comes into view, garlanded with the ancient rusty iron of the Tidespar facility. A long thin iron bridge extends out from the clifftops to the entry hall, and along it we plod.

# Coral Beheads

In the guard post, the gang spies three corpses in a heap in one corner. Their heads are completely covered in bleached-white coral growths. **Bash** goes to "investigate"[^1]. He finds nothing of interest, but as he pulls back, a sallow cold hand clutches his wrist as the body stirs to life. It takes a vicious bite out of **Bash** but **Nickel** smacks it very hard with a sledgehammer until it stops.

Fearing further mischief, **Brian** twists the head of the other two.

A rope bridge extends out over a long drop to the ocean below, leading to another part of the facility. It's old and grimy, but sturdy. **Brian** carries **Bash** across, as they have put their heads together and concluded if one is carrying the other the weight on the bridge will be halved. The wizards look on sceptically, but the bridge does hold.

In the next room a smell of mould and damp hangs over the scene like a shroud. This is the living quarters, a big hemispherical room with a set of beds and a small kitchenette. There's a trapdoor leading down, and another door leading out to a balcony.

**Brian** and **Nickel** head down the trapdoor to the storeroom below, to have a quick rummage. **Nickel** does so, revealing some rotten food, but as they do so **Brian** spies a mysteriously familiar head. He was pretty sure he tore this of a corpse not too long ago. Regrettably, this appears to be a brand new un-torn head, attached to a scrawny and hungry-looking body.

The creature lunges over the crates, and a furious battle in the darkness commences. The wretched zombies fight like cornered animals, and the crew takes a severe beating from them.

**Arcanon** attempts to turn one into a cockroach, unfortunately his magic fingers appear to be malfunctioning perhaps, or he's forgotten which finger is magic.

They eventually take them out, mostly due to **Bash**'s impressive and now very bloody horn. Midway through, **Brian** bodily hefts a coral-head, impaling him directly onto **Bash**'s face.

# Body Disposal

Patching themselves up, wiping off gore and coral bits from their clothes, and all quite pissed off, the gang decide to hurl the corpses off the balcony above. Just really to send a message more than anything else.

Out on the balcony, hucking a corpse over the rail to a satisfying plesh far down below into the churning waves, the party hear a voice call out from above them.

"'Ere, waste of good eatin' that!"

They whirl around to see **Retch**, the Gull Harpy, clung to the ladder a bit above them.

"Whatcha goan do that for, eh? Coulda 'ad that, could'n I!"

Very fortunately, there is another corpse still impaled on the face of **Bash**, and the party gamely offer it up. This makes **Retch**'s day, and definitely puts the party in his good graces (for all that's worth). He invites them all up to meet his wife **Yolg** at the top of the stack.

As they climb, **Retch** natters. He's really good at it.

# The Infinite Purple

At the top of the stack, a great big metal contraption lurks like a giant rusted beetle. Nearby, the party are introduced to **Yolg**, also very pleased to be given an entire corpse. They invite the party to stay as long as they like, regrettably their home is really just a patch of dirt under a scrabby tree.

As they natter, **Arcanon** has remained down below to ask the stars for a sign of the future using his _astrology_ skill. The stars reveal, beware the Hag, beware the Shark, beware the Water.

Above, **Retch** is telling everyone else about **Sleeper** the shark man, he's a piece of work apparently. **Abraca David** is feeling a little like the vibes are generally not the best right now, so decides to cast _Purple Lens_ on himself. Much better.

As the conversation draws to a close, with promises to drop by again soon, the crew turn back to the large metal machine, just as **Arcanon** joins them. **David** & **Arcanon** identify it as a void condensor, a machine to peer behind the veil of reality
