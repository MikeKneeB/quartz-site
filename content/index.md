title: Gently Rotting Online

This site collects my TTRPG writing and thoughts, as a designer and game-runner.

You can find my content on [Itch](https://gentlyrotting.itch.io/). You can also buy a physical copy of The Hand of God (the Troika 1:5 module I wrote) on the [Melsonian Arts Council Store](https://www.melsonia.com/the-hand-of-god-493-p.asp), or the PDF version on their [Itch page](https://melsonian-arts-council.itch.io/the-hand-of-god).

# About Me

I'm Mike, I write, run, and play TTRPGs, and have been doing so for about 7 years now. I play all sorts of games, but in particular a lot of [Troika!](https://www.troikarpg.com/), and I have a published Troika! module called The Hand of God out as part of Melsonian Arts Council's [1:5 project](https://www.melsonia.com/15-project-29-w.asp).

# Games
I'm currently running an ongoing game of [[Salvage Union - Ashkar/About|Salvage Union]], I'm just starting a game of [[Lancer - Tabernacle/About|Lancer]], and I run loads and loads of Troika! one-shots.
