Previously known as:
- The Revenge
- The Vengeance Control

The Vengeance Control Loophole is an Augmented Crawler. It looks like a giant mechanical centipede, with a huge number of massive legs. The interior is fairly tight and cramped, reminiscent of a submarine, but it's homily decorated. The rooftop decks are wide and expansive.

# Player Characters
## Laz0rbrn (they/them)
Laz0rbrn is a Hacker (adv.), they're a mysterious and reclusive individual. They have been known to pilot "unusual" mechs, their first being covered in meat bits.

Their current mech is the 13 12, a Mantis chassis.

## Jack (he/him)
Jack is a Soldier (adv.), he used to work for one of the corporations, but the less said about that the better. Jack certainly won't tell you.

His current mech is the Czar, a Brawler chassis.

## Athena (she/her)
Athena is an Engineer (adv.), she wears cool round sunglasses (these were looted of the corpse of Baines in [[1 Downing of the Atychos|the first adventure]]) and has a "pet" lizard called [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Dougal|Dougal]]. She also has an AI controlled turret, called Hank.

Her current mech is the Snaf-Three, an [[Mech Parts#^7760fc|INRI]] chassis.

## Gert (she/her)
Gert is a Hauler (adv.), she's gloomy as all hell (but starting to shine a little more), and used to be a raider.

Her current mech is the Slagathorus, an Atlas chassis.

## Wet Steve (he/him)
Wet Steve is not like the others. He's an enigma. A wet, wet enigma. My personal suspicion is that Wet Steve is some kind of hideous corpo experiment gone wrong. At any rate, he seems to leak way more than he should, apparently needs to stay moist at all times or he might die, and can don flesh suits.

Wet Steve is Smuggler (hyb.).

His current mech is Mr Nips[^1], an [[Mech Parts#^57d4eb|AGLA]] chassis.

# Non-Player Characters
## Hal (she/they)
Hal is the AI originally installed in The Revenge, who now overseers the whole of the Vengeance Control Loophole. They're soft spoken, mostly polite, and have a faintly maternal outlook of the crawler and its crew.

Hal manifests visually in holo projectors or screens as a collection of shifting platonic solids.

## Malachai Low (he/him)
Malachai is the (long-suffering) engineer in charge of engineering bay. He's got pale skin, long brown curly hair and a short beard.

## Yellow Halyard (she/her)
Yellow joined the crew from the Quality Control, when the two crawlers merged. She's the union representative for the entire crawler now. She's got deep brown skin, tired eyes, and an afro.

## Lorey Dust (he/him)
Lorey was the overseer of the Quality Control, a position he was in by lottery at the time and did not enjoy. He now works alongside Malachai in the engineering bay, and in particular manages the *Corrective Action*.

He's got black skin, bright keen eyes, and long dreadlocks.

## Dougal
Dougal is a lizard, who was "rescued" from the jungle by Athena. He now lives in the section of forest in [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#The Rooftop Garden|the rooftop garden]]. He has been armed, by Athena, who fitted a miniature (non-lethal, water based) gun to his back. He can use this to deter unwelcome attention from the crawler's children.

Dougal is really adapting to his new life with aplomb, he was pretty hacked off about the initial kidnapping, but now that he's settled into his new jungle and been fitted with weaponry, he's well pleased.

Dougal has six legs, and is sort of similar in size to a large iguana.

# Locations

## The Briefing Room
The briefing room is a small low-ceiling-ed room, with a large holo-map table. It seats about 16 maximum, and is where the salvage crew discuss their next mission with Hal.

## The Rooftop Garden
After stealing plans for climate stabilisers from [[Adamant Arch Planetary#Notable Sub-divisions|Arch-Novel]], the crew built one and set it atop their crawler. Along with the jungle fruits and seeds Athena & Gert brought back they now have a small section of thriving tropical jungle on the roof of their crawler.

## The Corrective Action
The corrective action is a inter-planetary ship-to-ship railcannon fitted to the back of the Vengeance Control Loophole. It can be brought to bear if it has a bead on a target, and one of the salvage crew fires a short-range marker flare onto the target.

The corrective action tags are: Over-far range // 30SP Damage // Ballistic // Deadly // Massive // Reload

Massive means can only be fitted to a crawler scale vehicle or larger, Reload means it can only fire every other round in combat. Over-far range means it can basically fire anywhere on an area map, as long as the crawler can get line of sight.
