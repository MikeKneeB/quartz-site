These are the setting notes and some of the notes for the missions/area maps for an ongoing game of [Salvage Union](https://leyline.press/collections/salvage-union) I am running.

The game is set on the moon [[Focis System#Ashkar]], which orbits a gas giant. The core rulebook has an implied setting more than a direct one (which I'm personally always hugely fond of), I'm nothing if not very extra so we're post (multiple) apocalypses in the far future, see [[A Galactic History]] for a high-level overview of the state of the galaxy. I also expanded the stock corporations into some slightly larger galactic conglomerations, with sub-divisions for spice - heavily inspired by Lancer.

The player's crawler is [[The Vengeance Control Loophole]].

Find the notes for the first mission at [[1 Downing of the Atychos]].
