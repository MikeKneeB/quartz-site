The Focis system was generated using the [DonJon Star System Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/scifi/system/), then modified extensively.

# Basic Stellar Details

|Type|K9 IV Orange Subgiant|
|---|---|
|Radius|1.70 x 106 km   (2.44 x sol)|
|Mass|1.85 x 1030 kg   (0.93 x sol)|
|Temperature|3500 K|
|Luminosity|3.08 x 1026 W   (0.80 x sol)|

# System Summary
- Focis is a sub-giant star
	- 2.5 times larger than Sol, but slightly cooler overall.
	- Takes up more space in the sky, and casts a warmer orangey light.
- Orbited by:
	- Ash, a gas giant at about 0.9AU.
		- Ashkar is a moon orbiting this planet (that’s where you are!)
	- An asteroid belt at about 1.5AU.
	- A rocky planet at about 2.4AU.
	- A cooling brown dwarf star at about 12AU.
- Gate out of the system orbiting at the L1 point between Ash and Focis, exclusively controlled by [[Adamant Arch Planetary|Adamant Arch Planetary]].

# Ashkar
Ashkar orbits the gas giant Ash, this is the only terrestrial planet in the system with a breathable atmosphere.

- Ashkar is:
	- Roughly earth-sized rocky moon (surface gravity 0.93 earth’s), and with a day cycle of 22 hours.
	- Orbits Ash at a period of 3 Ashkar days.
	- Orbits Ash out of the solar plane, meaning eclipses are rare.
- ~50% surface one large landmass, known locally as Ashen
	- Predominantly desert.
	- Varied biomes around edge of landmass, and on islands.
    - Extreme and relatively slow tides, creates complex ecosystem at shoreline.
- Local carbon-based ecosystem developed, but nowhere near sentient.
    - Flora tend to have deep green or red leaves, with some species exhibiting both.
    - Most common fauna fall into one of categories:
	    - Eight+ legged insect analogues.
	    - Developed large lizard analogue with a partial exoskeleton, found above and below water surface, six limbed.
	    - Small to medium mammal analogues, some of which are flighted, six limbed.
- Ashkar has been settled for a long time, multiple thousands of years.
- During the last galactic corporate war around 1200 years previous (known as the Agate War after the primary precipitator, the now-liquidated Agate LLC) the planet was a major staging ground for the now-liquidated Chen & West Industrial conglomeration, during the war the planet was effectively scoured, causing major biological die-back and a staggering human death toll.
- The planet's large open deserts are peopled by nomads and the unions (~1 million people), and a large number of corporate arcologies (~6 million people, mostly concentrated around the shores of Ashen).
- Technically overseen by the Ashkar Charter Board, functionally not an effective government, in the pocket of [[Adamant Arch Planetary|AAP]].
