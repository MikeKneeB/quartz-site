##### 10,000 Years Ago
[[The Argent Republic]] first forms, uniting the Galaxy for the first time under the rule of the Exarch AIs.

##### 5,300 Years Ago
The Silver Rain war breaks out, as the fading [[The Argent Republic|Argent Republic]] attempts to regain control of the galaxy. This ends up sparking rebellion against them.

##### 5,000 Years Ago
The Silver Rain war concludes, with the fall of the Exarchs and the dissolution of the Argent Republic.

The nascent Galactic Coalition forms, a loose governing body intended to ensure local governments are free to rule themselves, while respecting the rights of the people they rule.

##### 4,400 Years Ago
The first corporate war, the Charter War, breaks out and ends within 3 years. This signals the beginning of the Galactic Corporate era.

##### 2,900 Years Ago
Adamant Infrastructure forms, one of the corporations that will eventually gain enough power to become the first galactic super-corporation - [[Adamant Arch Planetary]].

##### 2,100 Years Ago
[[Regalia Luxe]] forms, born out of a network of planets under a complex monarchic/feudal rule.

##### 1,200 Years Ago
The Agate war breaks out, as some of the major corporations move to try and wrest power from the remains of the Galactic Coalition. The war ends after 76 years, culminating in the creation of [[Adamant Arch Planetary]], and Clementine Processing (which will eventually become part of the [[Clementine Laurel Corporation]]) amongst others.

The [[Focis System]] is the centre of some fierce fighting, having been a major operating centre for the Chen & West Industrial, a heavily involved corporation.

This signals the beginning of the Galactic Super-Corporate era. The Galactic Coaltion now wields effectively no power, and slowly fades to nothing over the next 300 years.

##### 400 Years Ago
[[Invoke Arms]] forms, seemingly from nowhere, and rises in power to rival [[Adamant Arch Planetary]], [[Clementine Laurel Corporation]], and [[Regalia Luxe]]. This is unprecedented, but completes the set of four super-corporations that control the galaxy in the present day.
