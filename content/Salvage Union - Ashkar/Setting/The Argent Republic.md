The Argent Republic was the central power in the galaxy for almost 10,000 years. The Republic was led by a group of hyper-advanced AI entities known as the Exarchs. The Republic fell in a slow decline, with the Exarchs becoming less and less interested with human existence, and letting their empire decay down to petty local tyrants exercising sanctioned brutal control over the populace on countless worlds.

Eventually, seeking to regain control, the Argent Republic began the galactic "Silver Rain" war almost 5000 years ago. This started as an attempt to bring local tyrants to heel, but this quickly devolved into an out-an-out rebellion against the Argent Republic's Interdiction forces and many of the ruling powers. Eventually the Republic burned itself out, and the Exarchs were felled.

It's worth noting that while they were called the Argent Republic, this was effectively an Imperial rule.

# Automata
 Automata is a designation given to AI entities, which were created by and acted as extensions of the Exarchs. They are far more advanced than the AIs generally available at the current time period.

Typically, the chassis that the automata is mostly housed in shares the same name as the automata itself. They're effectively interchangable, although it's worth noting that the automata core can be removed from the chassis.

## AGLA

AGLA is the name of an automata pattern used for warfare. They generally led interdiction forces in the Silver Rain War.

### Lost AGLA
The party encountered a lost AGLA unit when exploring an [[2 Scamander Point#9 - Abandoned Facility|abandoned watchpoint]] in the second mission. They decided to try and avoid combat with the entombed warrior, and the AGLA unit saw no real call to engage either.

This AGLA unit left their 5000 year imprisonment, and set about trying to awaken the Argent Republic abandoned gas giant station in the clouds of Ash.

This AGLA was eventually defeated at [[3 Facility N01#Facility N01|Facilty N01]], before he could escape to the gas giant above, but not before initiating contact to awaken the old station.

The AGLA encountered was accompanied by a NOX and an INRI automata units, and after reclaiming some meld fashioned an ABRAXAS, imbued with an automata soul from INRI's memory banks.

## NOX

NOX is the name of an automata pattern suited for stealth, subtelty, and general wetwork. Clever, careful.

## INRI

INRI is an automata pattern type that generally works alongside other patterns. It operates on a fundamentally different perception mode from people (and is even unusual among automata patterns). It's instinctive and devoted to other automatas.

## ABRAXAS

ABRAXAS is a hive type automata, capable of controlling and managing a whole network of distributed drone-type body parts.
