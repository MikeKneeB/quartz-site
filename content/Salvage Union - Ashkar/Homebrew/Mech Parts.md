They cannot use that system next turn, and the Venus Ascent can take a reaction once any time during that turn to activate that system as if it was a turn action the Venus Ascent was taking. This action does not benefit from any Frame Bonuses, systems, modules or pilot abilities of either mech. When targeting *wield* systems this system takes control of the system & whichever arm(s) it's held in simultaneously. The Venus Ascent can take this reaction even if it is unable to act otherwise (i.e. is controlled by another player).

# New Keywords
- Empowering: Each time you gain an empowerment add it to your empowerment tally total. Whenever you hit with a weapon attack, you may consume your empowerment to increase the damage dealt by half that amount (rounding up), and set your empowerment tally back to 0.
- Empowered: When you consume empowerment increase the damage dealt by the attack by the tally amount, rather than half.

# Design Notes

## AGLA's Design
- I don't think this mech chassis is actually strong enough for TL4. Once you get to less than 9 SP, taking an additional 2 SP damage per hit is pretty much crippling. Even though the buff at that SP level is incredible, and opens up some frightening combos (the [[Mech Parts#^7a1bf7|Omni Weapon Link]] was designed for this) its not enough to make up for the negative IMO.
- It's actually better at range than in close combat, which is not what I had in mind, but in some ways that's kind of fun.

## ABRAXAS' Design
- This might be too good for TL4.
- It's incredibly defensive, because it can cap damage dealt to it at 6 with the drones taking the hit instead.
- It's also incredibly good for projecting area shield systems out from the drones.
- There is a trade off, if you split your drones out too much, the core ABRAXAS unit can get caught out without a lot of defensive backup, and its low base SP means it can get pulped pretty quickly.
- Probably should have been TL5 at least.

## Hellfire Shotgun Design
- This is cool, and I'm proud of it, it's a fun weapon that interacts with heat in a way most other SU systems and modules don't.

## Penance Drive Design
- I really like this, but it is a bit weedy. I'll probably make a stronger version of this for use later in the campaign.

## Automata Control Core Design
- The control core really only exists for me to make NPCs, although if they can find an automata soul on their side maybe this will come in useful.
- The anti-hack stuff is interesting, frankly I was a bit afraid of [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Laz0rbrn (they/them)|Laz0rbrn's]] ability to take control of enemy mechs completely, and wanted a way to mitigate it. "Why not just use a firewall?" I don't know dear reader, I just simply don't know.
- I do think hacks not being effective against an advanced AI is narrative-appropriate though.

## Duplexer Control System Design
- Wow, this is a really powerful module.
- I basically wrote it because one of my players kept saying she wanted some way to have multiple mechs. She then did not make use of it. Go figure.
- It's kind of fortunate my player's have only used it to put an AFF coolant foam system on wheels. Which is very funny, but not really taking this item to its limit.
- It is kind of limited by taking up a precious module slot, and the SUB-CONTROL system needs to be given locomotion of some kind or it can't move. It also means if you lose part of your mech, you're in possibly some trouble until you can repair it.
- Ultimately, getting two turns instead of one is crazy, even if it comes with some hefty draw-backs.

## ARX-Grav Disruptor Design
- This is great fun.
- Moving onto a hex grid means we can play with positioning and movement a bit more, and while I appreciate that kind of game-y tactical combat isn't everyone's bag, our table has a lot of fun with it.
