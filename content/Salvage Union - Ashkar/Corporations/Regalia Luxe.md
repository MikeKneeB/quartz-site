Secretive ultra-luxury and biotechnology corporation.

Regalia is organised into a series 16 of partially hereditary houses. Each house participates in a kind of court/council politics, organised around the head of the currently ruling (prime) house. Business responsibilities are distributed among the houses in a complex web of political favour and maneuvering.

Regalia Luxe nobles are almost always attended to by gene-enhanced retainers - butlers, maids, and nurses. These are almost always born into service, and grow up alongside their charges.
