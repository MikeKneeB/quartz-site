# Mission Report

## Negotiations with Adamant Arch

During downtime, the crew meet with [[4 The Caldera#Jori Ungle & Retinue|Jori Ungle]] of [[Adamant Arch Planetary|AAP Propulsion Laboratories]] to discuss terms of a contract to recover [[Regalia Luxe#Scion Anastasia Eldrick (she/her)|Anastasia]] and anything she might have stolen from the caldera disaster site in [[4 The Caldera|the last adventure]].

Jori explains that Anastasia did indeed make off with a valuable computer core from the wreckage site, containing sensitive AdArch intellectual property. They have been tracking the distress beacon from the core, and it appears that Regalia have loaded it onto a high-speed train to take back to a Regalia site in order to let their software technicians loose on it.

Luckily, the train is going to have to slow down to wind through a region called Dead Heart Pass, where it will cross a wide canyon, and then go through a longish stretch of tunnel. After this, the train is able to accelerate again and will quickly reach mach-3, becoming effectively untouchable. [[The Vengeance Control Loophole]] will be able to get in for drop-off 36 hours before the train starts to move through this region.[^1]

Jori says AdArch will pay the equivalent of 30 TL 3 scrap to recover this computer core, plus an additional 5 if they also bring Anastasia back.

The crew asks for some gear and equipment to help them close in on the Regalia Luxe high-speed train, and Jori offers them the option to rent an [[5 Dead Heart Pass#Additional Supplies and Gear|ARIP-2]] for 5 TL3 scrap, or 6 taken from their pay. They elect to pay now, although with the note that they have to return this item or pay another 5 TL3 scrap.

The crew hatches a plan to plant bombs at point A on the [[5 Dead Heart Pass#Locations|map]], and shoot the [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#The Corrective Action|*Corrective Action*]] at B to break the tracks in both places once the train is on the bridge. They're then going to use the ARIP-2 to close the distance quickly, hopefully before the train security has a chance to react, get the goods and get out.

## Y'all got a Varmint Problem?

Disembarking the VCL at [[5 Dead Heart Pass#1 - Long Marsh|1]] in the early evening, the crew heads for the town of Solace, to gather some information about the local area.

Strolling into the town with their wide-brimmed hats, they gather some attention from the locals, but not an undue amount. Only one real option here, beeline for the saloon.

Inside, [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Wet Steve]] has a conversation with one slightly unnerved farm-worker, who directs him toward the sheriff, a man by the name of Gambit O'Malley[^2]. Gambit explains that:
- The bandits at Dead Heart Pass are very active, and take a tribute for "protection" from the town.
- Gambit's worried because the town's militia mechs are sorely depleted since [[5 Dead Heart Pass#Outlanders|Janine]] took off with 2 of them when her and her gang split from the town a few weeks back. Due to a disagreement with town leadership about the Dead Heart Bandits. They moved off up towards [[5 Dead Heart Pass#3 - North East Ruins|the north east city ruins]].
- The [[5 Dead Heart Pass#6 - Dead Heart Castle|bandit's fortress]] on the hill is where Annie Rockjaw resides. There well outfitted up there, Annie is probably ex-corpo and stole her mech from them when they left, and Gambit knows it's a serious bit of kit. They also have some turrets on the old fort in operation.

Information gathered, and a few town residents slightly put-off their after-work drinks by Steve, the crew heads out to see if they can find these outlanders, and talk some sense into them.

At the city:
- Found the ruined mechs, disarmed and looted!
- Saw a heron drone moving in towards the outlander salvage crew, and warned them in time for them to defend themselves.
- Convinced Janine to head back to solace, once the crew's mission is complete they'll work with Janine and Gambit to take out the Bandits and free the town.
- Went "fishing".
- Headed up to 9, then down into the abandoned station. Planted bombs on the tracks here, as a fail-safe if the bridge goes wrong.

## Additional Supplies and Gear

The crew asked [[Adamant Arch Planetary]] to provide them with some assistance, and they offered to hire out a piece of military hardware for 5 TL 3 Scrap. They are expecting this to be returned to them.

This very large quadruped subsentient-drone is AAP Propulsion Laboratories answer to the question "How do we get a mechs where they're needed on the battlefield?". What they've come up with is fundamentally a massive rocket engine on legs. The SURJ drive core packs an almighty amount of sustained thrust capable of lifting 6 armed & armoured battle machines into a tactically advantageous position at a moments notice, this comes at the cost of needing a complete refit after every firing.

Affectionately known as "God's Pogo-Stick" by APL lances that operate these devices.

The APL Armoured Rapid Ingress Platform MK-2 (ARIP-2) is:
- 10SP
- Locomotion System
- Armoured Plate x3
- Integrated: Single-Use Rapid Jump Drive (SURJ Drive), can be activated to move the ARIP-2 between any area on an area map in 1 minute. This system requires clear L.O.S. to activate safely. This burns out the SURJ drive, which must be replaced during downtime.
- Integrated: Cavalry-Grade SURJ-integral Mag-lock clamps. The cavalry-grade mag-lock clamps allow the ARIP-2 to carry up to 6 mechs with it when using SURJ drive. Due to the power draw required, this system is only active while the ARIP‚Äôs SURJ drive is also active.

The integrated systems are basically the core of this machine, and could not be easily reverse engineered to be re-mounted as systems on a standard mech, due to their highly specialised nature.

*We don't talk about the ARIP-1, it has attained a sort of psuedo-mythical status amongst APL operators.*

## Locations

![[dead_heart_pass.png]]

(We drew A, B, and C during the sessions to mark where things were planned to be highly explosive.) The crawler has to drop the crew off at 1, everywhere else is inaccessible.

### 1 - Long Marsh

Wide open marshland, mud seems fertile, lots of small green plants, no large trees.

Small farming sheds and supply stores dotted around.

Solace town sits here near the river. Largish farming town, good trade with crawlers and other wasteland settlements. Currently lost a good portion of young-ish workers over a dispute over the Dead Heart Bandit crew.

### 2 - The Valley East

The bridge sits high above, spanning the wide valley, which is dotted with small shrubs and bushes.

### 3 - North East Ruins

![[dhp_city_north.png]]

Area - T1//S4

Abandoned city blocks, nothing of note.

Area - T1//S2

Solace Outlanders trying to eke out a small living here. They‚Äôre having a pretty hard time. Led by Carol Molt, she‚Äôs just about holding this gang of ~100 mostly young folks together.

The outlander band broke away in protest of the Solace Council‚Äôs acquiescence to the Dead Heart gang‚Äôs demands of tribute.

#### 3.4 - Manufacturing District

### 10 - Tunnel Entrance West

West tunnel entrance, the train will be able to speed up very rapidly after getting to this point.
## Groups

I started adding group "wants" to these entries, I always find individual wants easy to come up with, but this kind of explicit group goals makes things easier to pull out from a moment. It also allows me to be pretty flexible with individual NPCs within them, so they can be salted to taste.

[^1]: I made a little oopsy here, and forgot that region map travel time is an hour in a mech, not 10 minutes (which is what I said for the first of these sessions), to account for my mistake we sort of retro-actively said the crawler got here eariler than that. They started session 2 of this adventure with 32 hours left on the clock, but had managed quite a bit of exploration in the meantime.

[^2]: I just asked the players for a good sheriff name here, and they absolutely delivered.
