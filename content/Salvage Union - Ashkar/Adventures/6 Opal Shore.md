For the next mission, having now been well paid by [[Adamant Arch Planetary]] for the retrieval of their computer core and a political/commercial prisoner [[Regalia Luxe#Scion Anastasia Eldrick (she/her)|Anastasia Eldrick]], the crew sets their sights on Anastasia's spaceship - **The Long Goodbye** - as a means to travel out of atmosphere and up to the planet of [[Focis System#System Summary|Ash]] hanging in the sky above.

They set off to the Opal Shore region, where **The Long Goodbye** is parked in the Sapphire Facility space port.

# Mission Report

## Trading Faces

During downtime, the crew cashes in both the computer core and Anastasia (their prisoner) with Adamant Arch, earning them a large paycheck, and the ability to refit their crawler to tier 4. With that done, they set about upgrading their mechs now that they have access to all tier 4 components for crafting.

They also take some time to talk to [[The Argent Republic#Lost AGLA|Lost AGLA's]] automata core, and learn some information about the old republic and the Meld (which the Republic knew as the Formulate). They also acquire a "key" to the facility in the gas giant far above, although this complex data packet to be transmitted in to the system resists any attempts to sift through it.

With this done, [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] whips up a disguise: he will become Elphantasia Eldrick, a minor scion of [[Regalia Luxe#XII Eldrick|the XIIth house]]. They also decide to bring Mabel - one of [[Regalia Luxe#Scion Anastasia Eldrick (she/her)|Anastasia's]] retainers. She has been issued the equivalent of a quad bike in mech terms, a small pair of exo-legs, from the VCL's stores.[^1]

## Welcome to the Jungle (Literal)

Stepping out from the hangar bays of the VCL, the crew moves out into the thick pine forest. The heady green scent mixes with the ocean's sharp salt wind, and the cries of animals moving through the trees calls out. The sun is high in the sky, but clouds on the horizon are rolling steadily closer.

After a while, the crew comes across a small clearing, and the soft lowing of a small herd of aurochs. These giant mega-fauna herbivores seem relaxed, from a distance at least, but the gang catches sight of a skittering in the undergrowth. A pack of large insectoid creatures are moving around, and Mabel hastily explains these are jabberwockys.

The crew waits to see what will happen, when suddenly the jabberwockys spring from the undergrowth and leap onto an aurochs, and the herd panics, quickly picking up speed straight towards the crew waiting in their mechs.

Thinking fast, and embodying the upper-class hunter type he's impersonating with his disguise, [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] opens fire on the herd - aiming for the creature the jabberwockys have launched themselves onto. He hits, after overcharging, and brings it down.

The herd is still stampeding, so he fires off another quick round, and brings down another auroch with a leg shot, driving the rest of the herd away in a different direction. [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Jack (he/him)|Jack]] moves in to finish the creature off, but senses the approach of a number of huge insects. As he approaches they begin to scuttle out from between the trunks toward him. He backs of hastily, just as a much more massive jabberwocky lumbers out toward the still lowing auroch bleeding profusely onto the forest floor.

## Welcome to the Jungle (Figurative)

Moving further through the forest, spying huge lumbering logging platforms swaying over the trees in the distance, the crew eventually breaks out onto the shore as the clouds open. Here they see the brutal concrete fortress of the [[#4 Sapphire Facility Shore-Side Campus|Sapphire Facility Shore-Side Campus]].

Approaching, papers are checked, and all seems to be in order. The crew is given access to the local comms network, and [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] pulls rank as Elphantasia to secure replacement parts for his mech, which he burnt out while firing off shots at the Aurochs (really unlucky overheat rolls).

From here, the crew makes their way over to the lift down to the tunnel at [[#4.2 Gate Down|4.2]], and are directed to the visitor zone on the elevator. Here, the crew see two mechs with them. On the descent down, these two dismount and the crew see a man with a large set of mutton chops and a black woman with a big afro. Mabel hisses out over comms that this is [[Regalia Luxe#Butler Horace Powell|Butler Horace Powell]], of the [[Regalia Luxe#III Locke|IIIrd house]], head butler to Lord Julius. She does not recognise the woman with him, but the crew is already mighty spooked by the appearance of a man they know they ripped off once before[^2].

Once in the tunnel (below the water it appears somewhat like those big aquarium walk-through tunnels) the crew moves off, making their way to the elevator on the opposite side. On the way, they spy something truly massive shifting through the murky kelp forests around them.

## No, no, no! I said a _Bloody Mary_

Now, above ground (or the ocean now actually) and back in the driving rain, the crew moves on. They ask for the location of **The Long Goodbye** and learn it is over in [[#5.5 West Hangar|the west hangar]]. Unfortunately, Elphantasia is issued an official summons to the welcome ceremony for [[Regalia Luxe#Enscion Nor Torpor (he/him)|Enscion Nor Torpor]]. This is, with regrets, mandatory.

The ceremony is not for another hour or so, but their is a small private lounge for VIPs. Perhaps Elphantasia deserves a drink for her hard work so far? (Shooting two herbivores, and being a total wretch to Jack - which is at least on character for the typical Regalia Scion).

Inside, Jack is directed to fetch Steve (keeping up that Elphantasia disguise perfectly). The entire rest of this scene is underscored by an increasingly ridiculous ongoing farce as Steve keeps insisting Jack has retrieved the wrong drink, while drinking each one brought over[^3]. He ends this scene phenomenally drunk.

At the bar, the rest of VCL crew talk to the barman, and glean some gossip. They mention that they spotted Horace Powell here, and the barman says he hadn't heard of any expected House III delegations - which is mighty suspicious.

Eventually, the ceremony is due to begin.

## Enter Nor

As the rain continues to lash out, the crew lines up in the stalls. The start of the welcome ceremony will see Nor walk out past ranked Regalia Military, with the few Scions and their immediate households (along with "Elphantasia" and the rest of the crew) seated in a covered set of stands. He will then be formally greeted and welcome by [[Regalia Luxe#Scion Ithaca Kryve (she/her)|Ithaca Kryve]] in a short ceremony.

As the [[#5.6 East Hangar|East Hangar]] doors open, the crew spies the heavily gilt robed Nor begin to walk out with his small retinue. As he walks down, Mabel points out a small glint on a rooftop some distance away.

A sharp crack, dulled by the incessant rainfall. A spray of blood out backwards from Nor, he crumples to the ground.

In the chaos that follows many things happen quickly. [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Athena (she/her)|Athena]] activates her heat vision, picking out a heavy set figure running along the rooftops. Jack zeroes in with his sniper rifle, calls out return fire over comms (smart) and takes a shot - hitting but not felling the figure. The VCL crew scrambles out of their seats (picking up Steve, who is exceedingly sloshed) and starts to sprint toward their mechs parked back near [[#5.]].

They mount up, and set off sprinting towards the [[#5.5 West Hangar|west hangar]], and there through the open door they spot Millie Maxx, sitting in the open cockpit of her mech. [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Gert (she/her)|Gert]] charges forward as the hatch slides open, and slams into the **Assert False**.

## Exit Stage Left

Violence begins, and swiftly ends as [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] disables the mechs legs with a swift pinpoint-targetted needle missile. The crew orders Millie to dismount, which she does, and Steve tranqs her. That gun's coming in super useful.

With that problem dealt with, and Horace nowhere to be seen (he got shot, and is limping to cover), the crew load up into **The Long Goodbye** after Mabel pops open the main hatch. The ship powers up, as the base continues to devolve into chaos. [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Jack (he/him)|Jack]] radios the control tower for permission to take off, and successfully convinces them that Elphantasia needs to be taken to safety.

With that, the ship powers away, illuminated by the [[#8 Amethyst Lighthouse|Lighthouse]] through the pouring rain, and back to the VCL.

## Locations

![[opal_shore.png]]

### 1 The Deep Forest

The forest is dark and stately, filled with the calls and cries of creatures in their natural habitat.

The forest has large logging platforms moving about it, they make a cacophonous sound, and stalk above the tall trees belching fumes.

### 2 Opal Shore Dome

The seat of a Regalia Luxe Dome. This dome is primarily a logging operation, felling the forests for luxury goods to be shipped off-world, where wood is less common.

### 3 The Logging Scars

The Eastern side of the mountain has been stripped of the pine forests, and remains as a scoured wasteland. Usually the forestry management of the Opal Shore Arcology would maintain the forest here, but the Jabberwocky infestation has severely hampered general operations, and is preventing re-foresting.

The ground is littered with large holes, and collapsed sections. The ground is somewhat unstable, and moving at full speed here will cause the ground to collapse down into the tunnels below, and attracting a Jabberwocky.

Deep in one of the tunnels, the Opus Institute team is hiding out.

### 4 Sapphire Facility Shore-Side Campus

![[sapphire_shore.png]]

The shore side Sapphire facility campus has some minor support buildings, warehouses, and the main garrison buildings.

#### 4.1 Warehouses
These large warehouses mostly house lumber.

#### 4.2 Gate Down
This huge gate leading to the underground tunnel opens and closes relatively slowly. The elevator here slopes down into the ground. It eventually meets a large underwater tunnel.

#### 4.3 Garrison and Ancillary Buildings
This is the site of the main House VI garrison at this port. Support buildings, and some admin.

#### 4.4 Mech Hangar and Engineering
This large mech hangar contains the House VI garrison mechs currently not in use or undergoing refit.

### 5 Sapphire Facility & Spaceport

![[sapphire_main.png]]

[[Regalia Luxe#Enscion Nor Torpor (he/him)|Enscion Nor Torpor]] from the IIIrd house has recently landed in Sapphire. He is touring the facility, a guest of [[Regalia Luxe#Scion Ithaca Kryve (she/her)|Scion Ithaca Kryve]].

[[Regalia Luxe#Butler Horace Powell|Horace Powell]] is intending to assassinate Nor, he was originally intending to pin the assassination on Anastasia, but with that plan in the toilet he'll take his chances. An opportunist to the last.

The primary top-side facility is mapped below, but there are 3 layers of science facility below this.

#### 5.1 Gate
This huge gate leads down into the facility, by way of a tunnel. There is a large service elevator coming up from the underwater tunnel.

The elevator makes a stop before coming directly to the service, into the bio-technical lab.

#### 5.2 July Rains
The July Rains is a lifter tug operating from the port.

#### 5.3 Indigo Outline
The Indigo Outline is a lifter tug operating from the port.

#### 5.4 Double The Fun
The Double The Fun is a lifter tug operating from the port.

#### 5.5 West Hangar
The west hangar currently houses the **Long Goodbye** ([[Regalia Luxe#Scion Anastasia Eldrick (she/her)|Anastasia's]] ship), along with various shipping goods and containers.

#### 5.6 East Hangar
The east hangar currently houses the **Faultless Blue** ([[Regalia Luxe#Enscion Nor Torpor|Nor Torpor's]] personal ship).

#### 5.7 Main Facility

Main facility building containing:
- Primary radio control
- Operations
- VIP lounge

#### 5.8 Storage

Facility external general storage.

#### 5.9 N2-Halberdier Heavy Attack

The Regalia Tactical N2-Halberdier is a brutal and heavyweight close air and high atmosphere attack flier, designed for slow-target heavy armour elimination. Enemy combatants have likened the sound of its flyby as "hell's own orchestra". Not the kind of subtle weapon RLT would usually field, but one of relatively few fliers capable of operating in the harsh atmosphere of Ashkar.

#### 5.10 Aircraft Runway

### 6 Topaz Spar

The sand bar has two Regalia Luxe minor [[Regalia Luxe#VI Kryve|House Kryve]] member's retreat houses here. Both houses are in a very petty feud.

### 7 Amethyst Bridge

The amethyst bridge connects the mainland the Amethyst Lighthouse. The lighthouse bridge is very well guarded, as the lighthouse is the primary defence platform for the local area.

### 8 Amethyst Lighthouse

### 9 Outer Islands

The outer islands have a small camp of Red Rum Alight pirates out here. They're waiting for a deep water shipment to come in, and will attempt to steal it as it approaches shore tomorrow. The boat is called **Iceover**.

### 10 The Hive

The central network of tunnels for the Jabberwocky infestation. Here lurks the great queen, deep within the network of the hive.

[^1]: Just basically a nothing so that she can keep up, it doesn't really matter. This is one thing that frustrates me a bit about SU, I think the game expects me to not handwave stuff like "can this NPC come with you", with the inclusion of Shotgun Pits etc.. We're on a crawler of 5000 people and there isn't a vehicle they can borrow? Sure there is.

[^2]: Fortunately they pulled off that heist extremely well, especially under the dust storm, I don't think Horace has any idea who they are.

[^3]: This was genuinely so funny, excellent work all involved.
