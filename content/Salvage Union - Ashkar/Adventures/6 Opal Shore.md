## Locations

### 1 The Deep Forest

The forest is dark and stately, filled with the calls and cries of creatures in their natural habitat.

The forest has large logging platforms moving about it, they make a cacophonous sound, and stalk above the tall trees belching fumes.

### 2 Opal Shore Dome

The seat of a Regalia Luxe Dome. This dome is primarily a logging operation, felling the forests for luxury goods to be shipped off-world, where wood is less common.

### 3 The Logging Scars

The Eastern side of the mountain has been stripped of the pine forests, and remains as a scoured wasteland. Usually the forestry management of the Opal Shore Arcology would maintain the forest here, but the Jabberwocky infestation has severely hampered general operations, and is preventing re-foresting.

The ground is littered with large holes, and collapsed sections. The ground is somewhat unstable, and moving at full speed here will cause the ground to collapse down into the tunnels below, and attracting a Jabberwocky.

Deep in one of the tunnels, the Opus Institute team is hiding out.

### 4 Sapphire Facility Shore-Side Campus

The shore side Sapphire facility campus has some minor support buildings, warehouses, and the main garrison buildings.

#### 4.1 Warehouses
These large warehouses mostly house lumber.

#### 4.2 Gate Down
This huge gate leading to the underground tunnel opens and closes relatively slowly. The elevator here slopes down into the ground. It eventually meets a large underwater tunnel.

#### 4.3 Garrison and Ancillary Buildings
This is the site of the main House VI garrison at this port. Support buildings, and some admin.

#### 4.4 Mech Hangar and Engineering
This large mech hangar contains the House VI garrison mechs currently not in use or undergoing refit.

### 5 Sapphire Facility & Spaceport

[[Regalia Luxe#Enscion Nor Torpor (he/him)|Enscion Nor Torpor]] from the IIIrd house has recently landed in Sapphire. He is touring the facility, a guest of [[Regalia Luxe#Scion Ithaca Kryve (she/her)|Scion Ithaca Kryve]].

[[Regalia Luxe#Butler Horace Powell|Horace Powell]] is intending to assassinate Nor, he was originally intending to pin the assassination on Anastasia, but with that plan in the toilet he'll take his chances. An opportunist to the last.

#### 5.1 Gate
This huge gate leads down into the facility, by way of a tunnel. There is a large service elevator coming up from the underwater tunnel.

The elevator makes a stop before coming directly to the service, into the bio-technical lab.

#### 5.2 July Rains
The July Rains is a lifter tug operating from the port.

#### 5.3 Indigo Outline
The Indigo Outline is a lifter tug operating from the port.

#### 5.4 Double The Fun
The Double The Fun is a lifter tug operating from the port.

#### 5.5 West Hangar
The west hangar currently houses the **Long Goodbye** ([[Regalia Luxe#Scion Anastasia Eldrick (she/her)|Anastasia's]] ship), along with various shipping goods and containers.

#### 5.6 East Hangar
The east hangar currently houses the **Faultless Blue** ([[Regalia Luxe#Enscion Nor Torpor|Nor Torpor's]] personal ship).

### 6 Topaz Spar

The sand bar has two Regalia Luxe minor [[Regalia Luxe#VI Kryve|House Kryve]] member's retreat houses here. Both houses are in a very petty feud.

### 7 Amethyst Bridge

The amethyst bridge connects the mainland the Amethyst Lighthouse. The lighthouse bridge is very well guarded, as the lighthouse is the primary defence platform for the local area.

### 8 Amethyst Lighthouse

### 9 Outer Islands

The outer islands have a small camp of Red Rum Alight pirates out here. They're waiting for a deep water shipment to come in, and will attempt to steal it as it approaches shore tomorrow.

### 10 The Hive

The central network of tunnels for the Jabberwocky infestation. Here lurks the great queen, deep within a network of tunnels.
