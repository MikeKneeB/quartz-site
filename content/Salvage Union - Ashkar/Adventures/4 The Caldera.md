The Vengeance Control Loophole salvage crew is after a big payout, they'd like to grab some high-end gear to outfit themselves before they head up to [[The Argent Republic]] station in the planet above.

To that end, [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Hal (she/they)|Hal]] has gotten wind of what appears to be some kind of industrial accident occurring at an [[Adamant Arch Planetary]] research station nearby.

No doubt the AdArch mercs will be moving in at the same time, and we should expect other large corporate interests to converge, but this is a prime opportunity to get in and steal some valuables from one of the big players without them being able to strike back.

# Mission Report

## Schmidt's Cleaning

Before departure, everyone suits up in hazard gear from the crawler's quartermaster. Good job we're TL 3 now, or this would be a tough area to explore. The crawler is directed to let them off at [[4 The Caldera#6 - South Runoff|the south of the caldera]], nearest the obvious easiest path in to the crater at [[4 The Caldera#11 - Caldera Pass|the caldera pass]].

Just out from the hangar bay, the crew takes a quick sample of the water runoff in the area, and sends it back to the crawler for processing. After a moment we get confirmation that, yep, try not to breathe in the fumes, and definitely don't go swimming. Specifics of what's in here will take a bit more time.

Moving off up to [[4 The Caldera#11 - Caldera Pass| the pass]], the crew spots a glint from what is almost certainly a scope hidden up in the rocks, watching the pass below. They open comms to whoever is up on the slope, who turn out to be part of the [[Adamant Arch Planetary|AAP]] cleanup and reclamation effort. Luckily [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Wet Steve]] has prepared a cover story: the crew are a contracted mercernary outfit called "Schmidt's Cleaning" (tagline, "We Clean Schmidt Up!").

The legitimate Adamant Arch mercernaries ask them to wait a moment, while they radio this back to their boss ([[4 The Caldera#Jori Ungle & Retinue|Jori Ungle]]). This was always going to work, because Steve's ability gives him a passable cover. However, my "does a random encounter happen" dice had come back with a big thumbs up, so having rolled the specific encounter up in the background, I needed a plausible moment to introduce it.

Enter [[4 The Caldera#Anastasia’s Circle|Anastasia]].

## Railrifles at Dawn

A vicious crack sounds out from the other side of the caldera pass, followed a fraction of a moment later by a horrific screeching explosion of metal as a railrifle round from an unknown assailant thwacks into one of the Hussars of the AdArch team.

[[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Athena (she/her)|Athena]] & [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] spring swiftly into action, trying to extort money out of the beleagured defenders ("You need to pay for the platinum package if you want our help."), as a battle begins.

Arrayed up on the slope, opposite the Adamant Arch crew is [[4 The Caldera#Anastasia’s Circle|Scion Anastasia]] and her retinue. The pearly pink, jet-type mech is irresistable. Who is this person, and why have they brought the Chapell Roan Special mech to a wrecked crater? The face of a severe looking young white woman with harsh eyes and straight black hair appears over the comms,

"Leave, dogs, and I'll let you keep your lives."

The entire vengeance control crew is instantly smitten. In the anime, everyone is drawn chibi-style with heart eyes, and Anastasia gets the blue lines of disgust over the top of her face.

[[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Laz0rbrn (they/them)|Laz0rbrn]] activates egg's mayhem to find out.[^2] Breaking through the firewall activated by one of the Solos, they learn that:
- This is Scion Anastasia, of the XIIth house of Regalia Luxe
- Her mission here is to reclaim anything of value from the adamant arch laboratory
- The mech names of the entire Regalia Crew:
	- PRIVATE PARTY (that's Anastasia's)
	- WILL BE DONE
	- IN DEFIANCE
	- GRAVESTONE
	- PLINTH
	- NURSE
	
	I'm really glad they asked this, the Private Party is a great name, the whole crew here is rocking some pretty ace mech names (except NURSE, which is a bit uninspired).

## I said it's a PRIVATE PARTY

And with that, battle begins in earnest, with the salvage crew now being fired on by the Regalia Infiltration team.

The GRAVESTONE & PLINTH units are unholy terrors, they're up in a prime position in the rocks, and well defended by the two brawler units and the PRIVATE PARTY. The setup here is rough for the crew, the terrain is not in their favour at all as they're fighting uphill.

The NURSE's drone helper is taken over by [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Laz0rbrn (they/them)|Laz0rbrn]], but unfortunately that still leaves the NURSE itself free to unleash tesla hell[^3].

[[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Gert (she/her)|Gert]] moves up the slope in the Slagathorus, which is an absolute iron-clad tank. Her net-launcher and [[Mech Parts#^6ce189|Grav Disruptor]] are deployed to keep the two brawlers at bay, while [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] and [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Jack (he/him)|Jack]] bring the weapons of Mr Nips & the Czar down on the IN DEFIANCE and crush it.

[[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Athena (she/her)|Athena]] is having a terrible time down-slope, as both her and Hank (her turret)'s rotary machine guns roll critical fails when firing, causing them both to become damaged.[^4]

Under a continued hail of railrifle fire, Athena patches up the Czar in the nick of time, and the crew manages to take down the rest of the Regalia squad, save from the PRIVATE PARTY. That mech can move twice as the others, and just barely avoids a launched net from [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Gert (she/her)|Gert's]] Slagathorus.

The battle concludes, with the retainers of Anastasia having ejected from their battle-scarred mechs, and Anastasia herself jetting away from the battlefield, soon a flash of pink in the distance.

The crew assesses the damage, and conclude that further advances into the caldera would be foolish and dangerous[^5]. So, they round up the captured Regalia Luxe members, and head back to the crawler. Not too much scrap recovered directly from this mission, apart from the salvage from the Regalia mechs, so the crew decide to get in touch with [[4 The Caldera#Jori Ungle & Retinue|Jori]] and turn the mercenary cover story into cold fact, and proposing to take a job with AdArch to track down the escaped Anastasia.

## Outcomes
- Some salvage from the battle.
- Captured the 5 retainers of [[4 The Caldera#Anastasia’s Circle|Anastasia]], and brought back to the crawler.
- Taking a job with AdArch to track down where Anastasia has got to.

# Adventure Setup

I tend not to completely finish prepping a location before we start running it, because typically after the first game in one specific region map it starts becoming clearer where the party is drawn too and what they want to do. Seen as we ended up not actually using this area very much at all, this whole setup section is pretty light-touch.

This is a poison swamp, very Dark Souls of me.

## Main feature
The caldera basin, this was an [[Adamant Arch Planetary|Arch-Novel]] research facility, which recently suffered some kind of serious disaster, and is now a smoking toxic ruin.

The Caldera facility was engaged in bio-titan manufacture/research, and produced the [[4 The Caldera#IONA|IONA construct]]. After the explosion, IONA is now loose, and the deeply hazardous materials used in its creation have spread into the surrounding area, mixed with the water from a lake that originally sat in the Caldera basin.

The toxic runoff is hazardous to breathe, and without preventative measures will cause an injury to be sustained every hour.

## Locations

![[caldera_full.png]]

I didn't draw the connecting lines on this one, because for the most part it all connects pretty much as you'd expect it to.

The crew had a choice of where to bring the crawler around, could have been anywhere on the outskirts (i.e. 5, 6, 7, or 8).

### 1 - Outreach

Tiny high-altitude wastelander village, torn to shreds by explosion from the facility 2 weeks ago, surviving village still picking themselves back together.

### 2 - Mountain pass

High peaks, whistling wind. 1-in-3 chance of meeting [[4 The Caldera#IONA IV Outriders|IONA IV outrider]] dismantling wasteland creature of some description, 1-in-3 chance of creatures un-dismantled but agitated.

### 3 - West Caldera Slope

Triple travel time over unpathed scree slopes.

Nothing else of note.

### 4 - East Caldera Slope

Triple travel time over unpathed scree slopes.

AdArch temporary forward operating post being setup here by a [[4 The Caldera#AdArch Reclamation Team B|Reclamation Team B]].

### 5 - Lampoon Town

Junker town, doing badly after the explosion. Hastily rebuilt on stilts, with help from Union Crawler Navel Terror, which has since had to move on.

### 6 - South Runoff

Outer fields of toxic runoff from the facility explosion. Dotted with islands, scrabby dying trees, craggy landscape.

### 7 - Goods Receiving

Main shipment in for the AdArch facility, including airstrip. Now covered in toxic sludge. 1-in-2 chance of [[4 The Caldera#Regalia Luxe|Regalia]] being here, if not they are in the tunnels from here to the inner caldera. D3 for which team it is either here or in the tunnels.

### 8 - North Runoff

Wide toxic wasteland, was a battlesite, dotted with salvageable mechs.

*Area salvage*: TL3 // Supply 6

### 9 - Inner Caldera

Ruined AdArch high tech manufacturing facility, lying in the toxic wasteland. Jori Ungle and Crew already picking through the wreckage. Battle, or extended salvaging here will attract  as a D3:
1. [[4 The Caldera#IONA IV|IONA IV]]
2. D3 [[4 The Caldera#IONA IV Outriders|IONA IV Outriders]]
3. [[4 The Caldera#Regalia Luxe|Regalia Infiltration Team]] (and then D3 for specific team)

*Area salvage*: TL4 // Supply 4

### 10 - Exposed Facility Exterior

Entrance to the Caldera internal facility.

I intended to flesh this out with a detailed area map, but we never got there so I didn't.

### 11 - Caldera Pass

Pass into the caldera, watched by [[4 The Caldera#AdArch Reclamation Team A|AdArch Reclamation Team A]].

### 12 - North Caldera Slope

Triple travel time, nothing else of note.

## Groups

### IONA

I added these "Hacking Inimical" abilities, because the core book implies that the bio-titans are partially machined, but doesn't really land specifically (AFAICT) on whether a bio-titan can be hacked or not. I decided to add this to limit hacking's effectiveness (they're not the same as a mech or a drone), but allow our hacker to actually engage in combat with them. 

Hacking is still incredibly strong against single powerful foes, so I think the limit proscribed here is fair.

The IONA IV autonomous weapon was developed in the caldera.

#### IONA IV Outriders

Giant Burrowing Worms, two spade-like digging front feet, huge mouth.
- 35 SP Each
- 1 Titanic Action Each per round, can be spent to move or make 1 bite attack.
- Burrower
- Giant Bite - 7SP // Melee
- Acid Spit - 5SP // Range: Medium // Explosive (2) // Burn (2) // Poison // Any creature hit by this attack more than once in a round becomes vulnerable.
- Hacking Inimical - Hacks can only last 1 turn, and can only affect this Bio-titan once before the ANTI-BODY ancillary programming organelle kicks in.

#### IONA IV

Gargantuan Burrowing Worm, enormous array of spade-like digging feet at front end of body, huge mouth.

- 100 SP
- 3 Titanic Actions per round, can be spent to move or make 1 bite attack. Can spend 2 to use Acid Hail
- Burrower
- Gargantuan Bite - 10SP // Melee
- Acid Hail - 7SP // Range: Medium // Multi-attack 3 // Explosive (3) // Burn (3) // Poison // Any creature hit by this attack more than once in a round becomes vulnerable.
- Hacking Inimical - Hacks can only last 1 turn, and can only affect this Bio-titan once before the ANTI-BODY ancillary programming organelle kicks in.

[^1]: What does this mean? I didn't specifically decide but I would have found something I'm sure.

[^2]: I do remind Laz0rbrn's player before they take this action that this is something that the Regalia team will know they did, and not look kindly on! This is really the pivot point of the session, I loved the players making the decision to hack in here out of sheer curiosity, but there was no going back from this now.

[^3]: I can't stop giving enemy mechs tesla coils, they're *so* fun.

[^4]: Damaged might be too harsh for a natural 1 to shoot, especially if there's no way to re-roll now, I'll try and make sure I don't do this every time.

[^5]: They're probably absolutely right, IONA is not to be messed with.
