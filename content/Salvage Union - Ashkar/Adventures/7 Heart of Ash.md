Far above the moon Ashkar is the great gas giant Ash. It looms large in the sky, a furious swirl of blood red and rust and dust. Within it, awoken by [[The Argent Republic#Lost AGLA|Lost AGLA]], lurks an ancient Argent Republic facility. Its name is **Ignis L433**.

Within lurks a shard of the Exarch **Senex Bellator XÎ”09**. The ancient mind turns over in long sleep, as around it the facility begins to wake with a churning groan of dust-choked metal. Long dormant systems and subroutines pull up from the long suspension and cold-power near-dormancy they have existed in as the facility begins to rise from the heart of the planet Ash, breaking the surface of the endless storms trailing cloud and contrails.

Its emergence does not go unnoticed, the various eyes of an [[Invoke Arms]] orbital research station around Ash, and the [[Adamant Arch Planetary]] controlled blink-gate at the L1 point between Ash and the star Focis is mobilising as fast as possible.

# Mission Report

## Ascent & Descent

In the weeks following their escape from the [[6 Opal Shore|Opal Shore]], the crew spend some time outfitting the **Long Goodbye** to their own specifications, and renaming it to the **Short Hello**. It's a flawless piece of subterfuge, and certainly no-one at Regalia Luxe will be able to put that together. 

With a crew assembled from the citizens of [[The Vengeance Control Loophole]], and a copy of Hal loaded into the ship computer core, they are ready to break atmosphere.

The trip up to the planet passes uneventfully, with the great planet of Ash slowly growing in the forward view screens. On approach, they are pinged for incoming transmission. An [[Invoke Arms]] research base is in high-orbit above the planet.

[[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Wet Steve (he/him)|Steve]] jumps to the communicator and lies his ass off, convincing the Invoke Arms base that they are an Opus Institute science team on their way to conduct tests. This will slow IA down somewhat, but they'll definitely know something's up eventually as the facility rises from the planet.

Nearing the facility proper, the crew spies a docking platform. It's severely damaged, but looks to be functional enough to land in so they do. Inside, they choose a docking bay with two other ships parked in it already. [[#1.5 Dock Bay D|Dock Bay D]] on the map.

Disembarking, they look over the two ships. They're both clearly ancient, and built in a style that seems unusual, and faintly reminiscent of AGLA & co.s designs.

Inspecting the first ship, which happens to be the **Hour Abhorrent**, they inspect the outside briefly before Jack decides to just plunge his sword right into it. Very luckily, he manages to avoid a catastrophic explosion being triggered, and superheated gas rushes out of the hole he's punctured - luckily harmlessly. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief[^1].

The **Hour Abhorrent** is searched for stuff, and within they find a _Clearance Beta_ access shard. Turning their attention to the next ship, the **What Remains of I**, they (first checking it thoroughly) break in. Inside here, they find intact computers and other bits and pieces and decide to hunt around a little.

There are the bones of the long-dead here, and the crew decides to try and work out how they died. [[The Vengeance Control Loophole#Laz0rbrn (they/them)|Laz0rbrn]] hacks into the ship's computer banks, they uncover security camera footage from the ship's exterior and interior. There's about 5000 years of absolutely nothing but slow decay and settling dust, but they scrub back to the "good stuff".

On the interior tapes, it looks like the crew were acting basically normally, until they all hurried inside one day, and then didn't really seem to leave. The Vengeance Crew watches these three figures slowly die of starvation over a period of around 3 months. They note that, there appears to be a lot of heavy tremors or shaking of the ship through the first week or so, followed by a series of more long-lived but less violent tremors for a few weeks following that.

On the exterior, the crew members can be seen rushing back to the ship, and the same tremors can be seen outside. They also notice that while there is a prominent day-night cycle on the exterior initially, over the course of a few weeks this dims until the exterior is always in darkness.

From this, they conclude that something happened 5000 years ago that caused the facility to sink into the Gas Giant, which appeared to trap the human occupants of the **What Remains of I** and caused them to starve to death.

### Encounters B

### Encounters C

## What Happened Here?

5,000 years ago, as the last days of the Argent Republic were sighted on the horizon, the Ignis Facility was raided by rebel factions. Rather than suffer the potential loss of critical intelligence to the dissidents, **Senex Bellator** sank the facility deep into the atmosphere of Ash, and flooded the facility with the life-hostile gases of the planet.

The facility went into dormancy, the fail-safes that should have let Ignis and it's master **Senex** rise up from the deeps were damaged in the attack, and the facility did not automatically reawaken. It has been in a stasis state since receiving the wakeup calls from [[The Argent Republic#Lost AGLA|Lost AGLA]].

## Locations

There are 4 security clearance levels:
- Alpha
- Beta
- Gamma
- Epsilon

### 1 Dock Alpha

#### 1.1 Dock Control Room

_Human Scale_

This main dock control room is filled with data banks and viewscreens, all dead and silent. The computer can be hacked, has basic information about the facility and specifically:
- Dock Alpha in and out
- Ships in [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]]

The door to 1.2 is sealed with a red warning light around the edge. The door is glass, and you can see that the exterior window is cracked through the clear door. There is a big manual lever to release the door seal.

- North to [[#1.2 Viewing]]
- Elevator down to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]

#### 1.2 Viewing

_Human Scale_

A big view window out to the stars is cracked and broken. This room is open to the gas giant atmosphere and is under higher pressure, and overriding the door will cause [[#1.1 Dock Control Room]] to violently match pressure as well. Almost no-one would survive exposure to Ash atmosphere without a protective suit.

Inside the viewing chamber are long benches. There are a number of corpses around, one of which is infected with Meld. It is inert in the Ash atmosphere, but will quicken in the presence of oxygen.

Hidden in the corner is a keycard to open the **Hour Abhorrent** in [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]].

- South to [[#1.1 Dock Control Room]]

#### 1.3 Dock Bay A

Giant cracked docking bay, filled with dust and bits and pieces. Open to Ash atmos. The main docking door is sealed.

- West to [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]]
- East to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]
- North to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.4 Dock Bay B

Empty docking bay, enclosed elevator connects to [[#1.1 Dock Control Room]]. It is security locked, requiring override or hacking (_secured_).

The ruins of some small AR mortal ships sit in the ruins here.

- North to (sealed, red lights) [[#1.3 Dock Bay A]]
- South to [[#1.6 Dock Bay C]]
- Elevator Up to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]
- West to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.5 Dock Bay D

Docking bay with two large AR mortal ships, both slightly smaller than **The Long Goodbye**. They are named, in the script of the AR:
- **Hour Abhorrent**
- **What Remains of I**

Both are locked, and have a complement of AR Heavy Security Drones, which can activate with tampering.

**What Remains of I** has suffered a reactor destabilisation. It is extremely hot on IR, and physically the chassis is almost scalding to touch. Physically jostling or damaging it would cause it to explode and _destabilise_ the area.

Within the **Hour Abhorrent** are a set of atmosphere suits, plus a set of maintenance equipment.

Within the **What Remains of I** is weapons and a _Clearance Beta_ keycard.

- North to [[#1.3 Dock Bay A]] (sealed, red lights)
- South to [[#1.6 Dock Bay C]]
- East to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.6 Dock Bay C
Clear docking bay.

- North to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]
- East to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]
- West to [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]]

#### 1.7 Main Elevator Room
The main elevator here is sealed heavily shut. There appears to be no obvious port to hack in. It requires the power core at [[#11.10 Main Hall]] to be active before it can operate again.

- Elevator down [[#10.1 Top Core]]
- West to [[#1.8 Ancillary Elevator 1]]
- East to [[#1.9 Ancillary Elevator 2]]

#### 1.8 Ancillary Elevator 1
Tight, enclosed room, red lighting. There is a dormant security drone in the centre of the elevator. It will reactivate if disturbed, or if brought down to [[#2 Security Watchpoint]].

- Elevator down to [[#2.2 Security Drone Hangar]]
- East to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.9 Ancillary Elevator 2
Panels on the wall here appear to be falling off and broken. Peeling them away would reveal a maintenance access tunnel.

Down the access tunnel is a security grate there is a terminal that can be hacked, to override the elevator security panel. There is also a service access way down to the lower struts at the base of the dock.

- Elevator down to [[#3.1 Elevator]]
- West to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

### 2 Security Watchpoint

#### 2.1 Security Control
The security control room has a human-scale operations room. It has a set of bodies wearing deep red fatigues, all of which are riddled with energy burns.

Inside the operations core are computer banks, and a sub-shard core of **Deep Indigo**.

Entering the operations core without _Clearance Alpha_ activates a laser grid, which descends from the ceiling. It is fatal to humans, and capable to causing severe damage to mech components inside the grid.

**Deep Indigo** is currently asleep, but can be flash-booted at higher speed. Once awake **Deep Indigo** will activate [[#4 Manufacturing]] to build himself a new body. **Deep Indigo** will wake up fully at alert level 4.

- Elevator down to [[#8.3 Elevator Room]]
- East to [[#2.2 Security Drone Hangar]]

#### 2.2 Security Drone Hangar
Large security hangar with set of security drones. Mostly dormant, some damaged. Large airlock to the exterior.

At alert level 3, the drones are reactivated. They will also reactivate if one is damaged in their vicinity, and raise the alert level by 1.

There are a lot of bodies around, in red fatigues. One of them has a pile of drones around it, and is carrying a homemade EMP blast.

- West to [[#2.1 Security Control]]
- Stairs and elevator up to [[#1.8 Ancillary Elevator 1]]

### 3 Depot

#### 3.1 Elevator
Elevator hall down to the manufacturing plant.

- East to [[#3.5 Corridor]]

#### 3.2 To Processing
Elevator down to 

#### 3.3 Storage

Storage room, requires _Clearance Beta_. Has 3 formulate containment caskets and ???

- West to [[#3.5 Corridor]].

#### 3.4 Formulate Storage
Formulate containment caskets sit in this room. There is a lot of loose meld constructs in this room, they will wake pretty quickly after sensing movement.

They were loosed not too long ago - due to power draw away from this room to help ascend the station out of the gas giant.

#### 3.5 Corridor
The corridor is lit with flashing red light. The west corridor wing is filled with translucent expanding foam, cutting off the hole in the wall at the end of that portion. The hole in the corridor has also revealed a service tunnel, which leads to any of the 4 rooms in this block. Getting to it would require clearing the expanding foam.

The south corridor has a green security field covering it. There is a corpse in it, it seems unaffected. Moving through it raises the alert level by 1.

- North West to [[#3.1 Elevator]]
- North East to [[#3.3 Storage]]
- East to [[#4.1 Main Manufacturing]]
- South East to [[#3.4 Formulate Storage]]
- South West to [[#3.2 To Processing]]

### 4 Manufacturing

#### 4.1 Main Manufacturing

Main manufacturing hall. Manufacturing machines will be producing extremely weird sculptures, they have forms reminiscent of machine interiors blending into fleshy human gore.

If the alert level is 3 or more the manufactury is producing sets of AR heavy combat drones. It creates a set in 2 hours.

At alert level 5 or more the manufactury is producing an AR Ultra Drone, which it will complete in an hour.

If the power plant in [[#11.10 Main Hall]] is repaired, it can produce things much quicker.

- West to [[#3.5 Corridor]]
- East to [[#4.2 Manufacturing Operations]]
- South to Exterior Walkway to [[#5.2 Orrery Main Chamber]]
- Interior west to [[#4.3 Frame Constructor]]

#### 4.2 Manufacturing Operations

_Human Scale_

Human scale manufacturing operations room. Also contains a shard of **Goliath Eye** in the large spherical casket in the centre of the operations hall.

**Goliath Eye** is awake, has been this whole time, and is wholly insane. It is creating the sculptures.

The manufactury can be remote overridden by security subroutines, but the security controls might be overridden by a clever hack. **Goliath Eye** could switch the manufactury to start producing maintenance machines, and direct them. But it probably won't without some coercion.

**Goliath Eye** needs to move to 5 because I drew it there in play.

- West to [[#4.1 Main Manufacturing]]

#### 4.3 Frame Constructor

The Frame Constructor is a large portion of the manufactury that is used to assemble automata. It requires _Clearance Alpha_ to open.

At security level 3 or more, the Frame Constructor has started work on **Deep Indigo**'s body. Outside a broken AGLA-Prime frame lies heavily on the ground, clearly very damaged.

**Deep Indigo**'s body completes construction after 10 hours.

- East to [[#4.1 Main Manufacturing]]

### 5 Orrery Chamber

#### 5.1 Orrery Subprocessor

- West to [[#5.4 Orrery Core]]

#### 5.3 Stairs Up

- North to [[#5.2 Orrery Main Chamber]]
- Stairs up to [[#5.5 Upper Level]]

#### 5.4 Orrery Core

The Orrery is a device to link automata minds through to an Exarch Conclave. Currently it houses the mind of **IPSOS** in an **IPSOS** Prime frame.

The **IPSOS** is carrying a security _Clearance Gamma_.

The Orrery is dormant, and requires the power plant in [[#11.10 Main Hall]] to be repaired before it can operate again.

Gutted

- West to [[#5.2 Orrery Main Chamber]]

#### 5.5 Upper Level

Upper level looks down on the Orrery main chamber. Large banks of computers and operations machines can be used to control Orrery function.
