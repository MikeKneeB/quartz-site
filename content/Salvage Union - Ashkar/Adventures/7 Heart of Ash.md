Far above the moon Ashkar is the great gas giant Ash. It looms large in the sky, a furious swirl of blood red and rust and dust. Within it, awoken by [[The Argent Republic#Lost AGLA|Lost AGLA]], lurks an ancient Argent Republic facility. Its name is **Ignis L433**.

Within lurks a shard of the Exarch **Senex Bellator XÎ”09**. The ancient mind turns over in long sleep, as around it the facility begins to wake with a churning groan of dust-choked metal. Long dormant systems and subroutines pull up from the long suspension and cold-power near-dormancy they have existed in as the facility begins to rise from the heart of the planet Ash, breaking the surface of the endless storms trailing cloud and contrails.

Its emergence does not go unnoticed, the various eyes of an [[Invoke Arms]] orbital research station around Ash, and the [[Adamant Arch Planetary]] controlled blink-gate at the L1 point between Ash and the star Focis is mobilising as fast as possible.

# Adventure Setup

This is intended as a mega-dungeon type area, with the crew making multiple forays into the Ignis L433 system, to probably find some way to stop, shut-down, or otherwise disable the waking of the shard of **Senex Bellator** the god-machine tyrant heart of the facility.

## Main Feature
The heart of the **Ignis L433** facility.

## Threats
- Ignis Security Forces
- Ancient and Degrading Facility Interior
- [[Invoke Arms#Notable Sub-divisions|Invoke Visions]] Oracle & Attendants, swift dispatched for high-risk exploration and reconaissance
- [[Adamant Arch Planetary#Notable Sub-divisions|AAP Propulsion Laboratory]] Battlegroup, mobilising more slowly but bringing heavy weaponry for a full secure and acquire operation

## Weather

It's fucking windy out there, but inside it's basically fine. Outside, atmosphere is non-breathable, and the pressure is 3.5 standard.

| Roll | Exterior Weather |
| --- | --- |
| 20 | Eerily calm, surprising visibility |
| 11-19 | Stormy winds, moderate visibility |
| 6-10 | Heavy storm, poor visibility, flight impossible, all non-melee attacks take -d10, missile attacks take -2d10 |
| 2-5 | Extreme storm, poor visibility, flight impossible, either move or action on a turn not both, missiles can't hit targets, all other non-melee attacks take -d10, reduce range of all attacks by one band |
| 1 | Lightning storm, as above, after ten minutes outside characters piloting mechs roll d20, on a 1 they must roll on the reactor overload table. For each further ten minutes roll again, increasing the failure number by 1 each time |

## Locations

### 1 Dock Alpha

#### 1.1 Dock Control Room

_Human Scale_

This main dock control room is filled with data banks and viewscreens, all dead and silent. The computer can be hacked, has basic information about the facility and specifically:
- Dock Alpha in and out
- Ships in [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]]

The door to 1.2 is sealed with a red warning light around the edge. The door is glass, and you can see that the exterior window is cracked through the clear door. There is a big manual lever to release the door seal.

- North to [[#1.2 Viewing]]
- Elevator down to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]

#### 1.2 Viewing

_Human Scale_

A big view window out to the stars is cracked and broken. This room is open to the gas giant atmosphere and is under higher pressure, and overriding the door will cause [[#1.1 Dock Control Room]] to violently match pressure as well. Almost no-one would survive exposure to Ash atmosphere without a protective suit.

Inside the viewing chamber are long benches. There are a number of corpses around, one of which is infected with Meld. It is inert in the Ash atmosphere, but will quicken in the presence of oxygen.

Hidden in the corner is a keycard to open the **Hour Abhorrent** in [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]].

- South to [[#1.1 Dock Control Room]]

#### 1.3 Dock Bay A

Giant cracked docking bay, filled with dust and bits and pieces. Open to Ash atmos. The main docking door is sealed.

- West to [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]]
- East to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]
- North to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.4 Dock Bay B

Empty docking bay, enclosed elevator connects to [[#1.1 Dock Control Room]]. It is security locked, requiring override or hacking (_secured_).

The ruins of some small AR mortal ships sit in the ruins here.

- North to (sealed, red lights) [[#1.3 Dock Bay A]]
- South to [[#1.6 Dock Bay C]]
- Elevator Up to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]
- West to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.5 Dock Bay D

Docking bay with two large AR mortal ships, both slightly smaller than **The Long Goodbye**. They are named, in the script of the AR:
- **Hour Abhorrent**
- **What Remains of I**

Both are locked, and have a complement of AR Heavy Security Drones, which can activate with tampering.

**What Remains of I** has suffered a reactor destabilisation. It is extremely hot on IR, and physically the chassis is almost scalding to touch. Physically jostling or damaging it would cause it to explode and _destabilise_ the area.

Within the **Hour Abhorrent** are a set of atmosphere suits, plus a set of maintenance equipment.

Within the **What Remains of I** is weapons and a _Clearance Beta_ keycard.

- North to [[#1.3 Dock Bay A]] (sealed, red lights)
- South to [[#1.6 Dock Bay C]]
- East to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.6 Dock Bay C
Clear docking bay.

- North to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]
- East to [[#1.4 Dock Bay B]]
- West to [[#1.5 Dock Bay D]]

#### 1.7 Main Elevator Room
The main elevator here is sealed shut, heavily shut. There appears to be no obvious port to hack in.

- Elevator down 
- West to [[#1.8 Ancillary Elevator 1]]
- East to [[#1.9 Ancillary Elevator 2]]

#### 1.8 Ancillary Elevator 1
Tight, enclosed room, red lighting. There is a dormant security drone in the centre of the elevator. It will reactivate if disturbed, or if brought down to [[#2 Security Watchpoint]].

- Elevator down to [[#2.2 Security Drone Hangar]]
- East to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

#### 1.9 Ancillary Elevator 2
Panels on the wall here appear to be falling off and broken. Peeling them away would reveal a maintenance access tunnel.

Down the access tunnel is a security grate there is a terminal that can be hacked, to override the elevator security panel. There is also a service access way down to the lower struts at the base of the dock.

- Elevator down to 
- West to [[#1.7 Main Elevator Room]]

### 2 Security Watchpoint

#### 2.1 Security Control
The security control room has a human-scale operations room. It has a set of bodies wearing deep red fatigues, all of which are riddled with energy burns.

Inside the operations core are computer banks, and a sub-shard core of **Deep Indigo**.

Entering the operations core without _Clearance Epsilon_ activates a laser grid, which descends from the ceiling. It is fatal to humans, and capable to causing severe damage to mech components inside the grid.

**Deep Indigo** is currently asleep, but can be flash-booted at higher speed. Once awake **Deep Indigo** will activate [[#4 Manufacturing]] to build himself a new body. **Deep Indigo** will wake up fully at alert level 4.

- Elevator down to 
- East to [[#2.2 Security Drone Hangar]]

#### 2.2 Security Drone Hangar
Large security hangar with set of security drones. Mostly dormant, some damaged. Large airlock to the exterior.

At alert level 3, the drones are reactivated. They will also reactivate if one is damaged in their vicinity, and raise the alert level by 1.

There are a lot of bodies around, in red fatigues. One of them has a pile of drones around it, and is carrying a homemade EMP blast.

- Stairs and elevator up to [[#1.8 Ancillary Elevator 1]]

### 3 Depot

#### 3.1 Elevator
Elevator hall down to the manufacturing plant.

- Elevator up to [[#1.9 Ancillary Elevator 2]]
- East to [[#3.5 Corridor]]

#### 3.2 To Processing
Elevator down to 

#### 3.3 Storage

Storage room, requires _Clearance Beta_. Has 3 formulate containment caskets and ???

- West to [[#3.5 Corridor]].

#### 3.4 Formulate Storage
Formulate containment caskets sit in this room. There is a lot of loose meld constructs in this room, they will wake pretty quickly after sensing movement.

#### 3.5 Corridor
The corridor is lit with flashing red light. The west corridor wing is filled with translucent expanding foam, cutting off the hole in the wall at the end of that portion. The hole in the corridor has also revealed a service tunnel, which leads to any of the 4 rooms in this block. Getting to it would require clearing the expanding foam.

The south corridor has a green security field covering it. There is a corpse in it, it seems unaffected. Moving through it raises the alert level by 1.

- East to [[#4.1 Main Manufacturing]]
- South East to [[#3.4 Formulate Storage]]
- South West to [[#3.2 To Processing]]

### 4 Manufacturing

#### 4.1 Main Manufacturing

Main manufacturing hall. Manufacturing machines will be producing extremely weird sculptures, they have forms reminiscent of machine interiors blending into fleshy human gore.

If the alert level is 3 or more the manufactury is producing sets of AR heavy combat drones. It creates a set in 2 hours.

At alert level 5 or more the manufactury is producing an AR Ultra Drone, which it will complete in an hour.

- West to [[#3.5 Corridor]]
- East to [[#4.2 Manufacturing Operations]]
- South to Exterior Walkway to [[#5.2 Orrery Main Chamber]]
- Interior west to [[#4.3 Frame Constructor]]

#### 4.2 Manufacturing Operations

_Human Scale_

Human scale manufacturing operations room. Also contains a shard of **Goliath Eye** in the large spherical casket in the centre of the operations hall.

**Goliath Eye** is awake, has been this whole time, and is wholly insane. It is creating the sculptures.

The manufactury can be remote overridden by security subroutines, but the security controls might be overridden by a clever hack. **Goliath Eye** could switch the manufactury to start producing maintenance machines, and direct them. But it probably won't without some coercion.

- West to [[#4.1 Main Manufacturing]]

#### 4.3 Frame Constructor

The Frame Constructor is a large portion of the manufactury that is used to assemble automata. It requires _Clearance Gamma_ to open.

At security level 4 or more, the Frame Constructor has started work on **Deep Indigo**'s body. Outside a broken AGLA-X frame lies heavily on the ground, clearly very damaged.

**Deep Indigo**'s body completes construction after 10 hours.

- East to [[#4.1 Main Manufacturing]]

### 5 Orrery Chamber

#### 5.1 Orrery Subprocessor

Small cramped room, containing a great deal of technical machinery and servers. Cracked formulate containment barrels sit here, and a pretty big group of Meld is lurking in the corners of this room.

- South to [[#5.2 Orrery Main Chamber]]

#### 5.2 Orrery Main Chamber

Large baroque machinery in the centre of the room dominates this space. It is surrounded by a green security grid. The [[#5.5 Upper Level]] is visible above.

There is an Ultra Security Drone wired into the roof, clearly visible. It is activated if the security grid is broken.
